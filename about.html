<p>All the images are captured by Raquel Marie with a Canon Power Shot SX, an analog Minolta Xd 11, an Olympus OM-D, or an iPhone.</p>
    
<p>Inspired and influenced by street photography from the late 19th century to the early and mid 20th century, Raquel Marieâ€™s personal style of photography is predominately black and white. She aims to take photographs that look timeless with more of a focus on natual light, shadows, and composition. 
    Within her photographs, she aspires to take each viewer on a trip to the past, to a time when technology and artificial intelligence were still unimaginable.
